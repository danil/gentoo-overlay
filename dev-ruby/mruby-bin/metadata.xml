    mruby is the lightweight implementation of the Ruby language complying to (part of) the ISO standard. mruby can be linked and embedded within your application. We provide the interpreter program "mruby" and the interactive mruby shell "mirb" as examples. You can also compile Ruby programs into compiled byte code using the mruby compiler "mrbc". All those tools reside in "bin" directory. The "mrbc" is also able to generate compiled byte code in a C source file. You can check the "mrbtest" program under the "test" directory.
    This achievement was sponsored by the Regional Innovation Creation R&amp;D Programs of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan.
