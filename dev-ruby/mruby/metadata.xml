    mruby is the lightweight implementation of the Ruby language
    complying to (part of) the ISO standard. Its syntax is Ruby 1.9
    compatible.
    mruby can be linked and embedded within your application. We
    provide the interpreter program "mruby" and the interactive mruby
    shell "mirb" as examples. You can also compile Ruby programs into
    compiled byte code using the mruby compiler "mrbc". All those tools
    reside in the "bin" directory. "mrbc" is also able to generate
    compiled byte code in a C source file, see the "mrbtest" program under
    the "test" directory for an example.
